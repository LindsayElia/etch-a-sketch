# etch-a-sketch
A three day project using the [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) library, to create single page, interactive game reminiscent of an [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch) toy.

Users can create a pencil-line sketch using the arrow keys on their keyboard.

This game does not require audio to play, although there is an audio element when the 'erase' button is clicked.

Demo is at [lindsayelia.github.io/etch-a-sketch/](http://lindsayelia.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
